# Guess The Frame — GitHub Pages Ready

Single-file party game for 4 players and an umpire rotation. This zip includes:
- `index.html` (no build step, no dependencies)
- `pack.json` (starter content)
- `assets/` (60 placeholder images — replace with your own frames)

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a public repo and upload the folder contents (or just upload the zip and extract on GitHub).
2. Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main`/root.
3. Open `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`

## Replace placeholders
- Put your images into `assets/hollywood`, `assets/indian`, `assets/eyes` keeping the same filenames.
- Or edit `pack.json` and the app’s Content Packs to point to any URLs you prefer.
